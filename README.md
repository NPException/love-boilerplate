Love-boilerplate
================

My boilerplate code with gamestate, gui and menus for game jams like [ludum dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/)

Uses the following libraries:
* [hump](https://github.com/vrld) for vectors, gamestates etc. pp.
* [Quickie](https://github.com/vrld/Quickie) for buttons and menus
* [SLAM](https://github.com/vrld/Stuff/tree/master/slam) for better sound control
* [tween.lua](https://github.com/kikito/tween.lua)

Planned: Proxies, Highscore, open for suggestions...

Credits and thanks go to [VRLD](https://github.com/vrld/) and Kikito!
